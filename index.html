    <h2>Profile</h2>

    <hr>
    <p>Having completed the <em>International Baccalaureate</em> and having received a first-class bachelor of computer science at <em>Lancaster University</em>, I have developed an analytical state of mind, work ethic, as well as flexibility in life and the 
        workplace. I possess profound knowledge of <u>digital systems</u>, <u>low-</u> and <u>high-level</u> <u>object-oriented</u> and 
        <u>functional programming</u>, <u>databases</u> and <u>networks</u>. I´m a natural mathematician which helps me explore and 
        solve problems in more depth, and more efficiently.
